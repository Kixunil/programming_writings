# Writings about programming

This repository contains my thoughts on programming in written form.
This is a bit of an experiment to see if publishing such things using GitHub is a good idea.
You can watch this repository if you're interested in seeing more articles.
I also have a very similar repository about [information security](https://github.com/Kixunil/security_writings).

Since I'm starting and I'm not sure what kind of subscription/notification mechanism people prefer and what topics they are interested in, I decided to create [a simple form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScv1P1cnWThkXsMqLMOaV0RMG3925F9uDBFKxLArVW2jdm2Jw/viewform?usp=sf_link) for you to tell me which way do you prefer.
By filling that form, you'll decrease the chance that you'll miss something from me, so go ahead, it has only up to four questions!

The is currently a single article in the repository:

* [How Rust language secures your code](how_rust_secures_your_code.md) - explains how Rustt can help you avoid many common, annoying bugs, leading to safer and more stable code.
