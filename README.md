# Writings about programming

This repository contains my thoughts on programming in written form.
This is a bit of an experiment to see if publishing such things using GitHub is a good idea.
You can watch this repository if you're interested in seeing more articles.
I also have a very similar repository about [information security](https://github.com/Kixunil/security_writings).

The are currently these articles in the repository:

* [How Rust language secures your code](how_rust_secures_your_code.md) - explains how Rust can help you avoid many common, annoying bugs, leading to safer and more stable code.
* [Reasons NOT to use excavators](excavators.md) - an analogy, read and see for yourself :)
* [Packaging is not dead](packaging_is_not_dead.md) - argues that some of the advantages of distribution packaging are still valuable today
